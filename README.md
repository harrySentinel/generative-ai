## 🚀 Current Project

A smart, beginner-friendly chatbot designed to explain **Data Structures & Algorithms** concepts using natural language.

**What it does:**
- Answers DSA questions in a simple, clear way
- Acts like an instructor to guide beginners

**Tech Stack:**
- 🧠 Gemini API (Google Generative AI)
- ⚛️ React (Frontend)

> This is my first step into integrating GenAI into real-world use cases.
