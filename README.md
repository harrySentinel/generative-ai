# 🧠 Generative AI Projects

Welcome to my Generative AI repository!  
This is a growing collection of AI experiments and practical projects that I’m building to learn and explore the world of GenAI — one step at a time.

## 🚀 Current Project

### 🤖 Rude DSA Instructor Chatbot

An AI chatbot that teaches **Data Structures & Algorithms** to beginners — but with a twist.  
It’s straightforward, blunt, and even a little rude when you ask off-topic or silly questions.  
Perfect for those who need **no-nonsense explanations** and a few roasts along the way 😄

> It explains DSA concepts clearly — but don’t expect it to sugarcoat anything!

## 📚 Coming Soon

This repo will also serve as a personal learning playground.  
I'll soon be diving deeper into the world of GenAI with:

- 🔍 **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- 🧠 **Vector Databases** (like **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, etc.)
- 📦 **Tokenization & Embeddings**
- 🔗 **LangChain**
- 🧭 **AI Agents** with tools and context
- 🧪 **Prompt Engineering Experiments**
- 📘 My personal notes and summaries for each topic

Stay tuned for regular updates!
